# VagrantExercise
This repository contains the infrastructure to spin up a Linux virtual box and a NodeJS application

1. Clone the repository
2. Spin up the virtual machines (requires ubuntu/trusty32 box)
3. Vagrant should run a provisioning file to install Apache and NodeJS on the server
4. Vagrant should sync the "src" folder on host to the vagrant folder in guest to include the NodeJS app
5. Start the NodeJs application

Pay careful attention to IP address, ports, and box names
